# suppose you want to search for a particular word from a string then you can do
# Note -: In python also indexes start with 0

# example 1

name = "Abhishek Kamat"
print(name.find('A'))

# o/p -: 0 (we got the index of A)
# If we dont find the word the it will return -1


# example 2

name = "Abhishek Kamat"
result = name.replace('Kamat','Patil')

print(result)

# o/p-: Abhishek Patil
